# Combining Modern C++ and Lua

This repository contains the slides for my upcoming presentation at [C++ On Sea 2020](https://cpponsea.uk/). The presentation is written using the excellent [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) framework and is available online.

The repository for the LuaChat example application is available [here](http://github.com/jamespascoe/LuaChat.git).
